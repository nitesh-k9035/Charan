        <h2>About Lord Krishna</h2>
        <p>
            Lord Krishna is one of the most revered deities in Hinduism, known for his divine playfulness, wisdom, and love. 
            He is often depicted as a young man playing the flute, surrounded by nature and devotees. 
            Krishna is considered the eighth avatar of Vishnu and is celebrated for his teachings in the Bhagavad Gita, 
            where he imparts spiritual wisdom and guidance to Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.
        </p>
        <p>
            Krishna's life is filled with enchanting stories, from his childhood exploits in Vrindavan to his role in the Mahabharata. 
            He is also known for his divine love for Radha, symbolizing the ultimate union of the soul with the divine.
